# Known Issues

## [2025-08-11] CSS/Tailwind/Styling Not Loading (Resolved)

### Issue

After some edits, the app loaded with only browser default stylesâ€”no Tailwind or custom CSS. This was due to Vite not injecting the stylesheet, usually caused by:

- Missing or broken `index.css` import in `main.tsx`
- CSS/Tailwind syntax errors
- Corrupted Vite cache or build artifacts
- Config errors in `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.js`, or `postcss.config.js`

### Solution

- Verified `index.css` import in `main.tsx`
- Checked all config files for typos/misconfigurations
- Cleared caches: removed `node_modules/.vite`, `dist`, and `node_modules`, then reinstalled dependencies with Yarn
- Fixed any CSS syntax errors
- Restarted dev server (`yarn dev`)

### Prevention Tips

- After any config/dependency edit, always check CSS imports/configs and clear Vite cache if styles disappear
- Use editor error highlighting for CSS/Tailwind
- If styles are missing, check browser dev tools for stylesheet loading and restart dev server if needed

**2025-07-27 Update:**

- All critical CSS/TS errors are resolved.
- If you encounter build or runtime errors, see DEV_SERVER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md.
- Minor warnings (e.g. unused vars) may appear but do not block build.

## LightningCSS Native Module Issue on Windows

### Issue

The local development server for the Sandpiper Run Unit Access Request Form project on Windows was failing to start due to a missing native module error related to lightningcss (`lightningcss.win32-x64-msvc.node`).

### Cause

This is a known issue with rollup dependencies and native modules on Windows when using npm.

### Attempts to Fix

- Running `yarn dev` resolved startup where `npm run dev` and `npx vite` failed.
- Installing missing rollup dependencies did not resolve the issue with npm.
- A manual Vite start script also failed to bypass the npm-related error.

### Resolution

Switching to Yarn for dependency management and running the dev server resolved the issue. Yarn handles native dependencies better on Windows in this context.

### Outcome

The dev server started successfully, and the application loaded the initial page with the Sandpiper Run logo and email entry form.

### Best Practices to Avoid Similar Issues

- Prefer using Yarn over npm on Windows for this project to avoid native module issues.
- Keep dependencies updated and monitor lightningcss and related packages for Windows compatibility improvements.
- Consider containerized or online development environments to avoid local environment inconsistencies.
- Document this known issue and resolution in project documentation for future developers.

# Additional Tips for Project Development

- Regularly run `yarn install` and `yarn dev` to ensure dependencies and dev server work correctly.
- Use environment variables and configuration files to manage different environments (development, staging, production).
- Test deployment on platforms like Vercel or Netlify as an alternative to local development.
- Maintain clear documentation for setup, troubleshooting, and deployment.
